# SEED Version 2.7.2

SEED Version 2.7.2 includes the introduction of API v3. This new API version will
enable users to "Try" v3 endpoints using the Swagger page as well as improve on and
consolidate previous API versions.  Endpoints have been copied over from previous versions.
Many were left as is - functionally remaining the same. Some were copied over and enhanced.
Others were identified as no longer used or redundant; these are slated for deprecation
and were not copied over at all.

The current list of endpoints slated for deprecation can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16SrXFM9ypLs5KD0MLrhvttIFO40rTU74mS438XchhAg/edit?usp=sharing).
Deprecation will occur with the deactivation of endpoints contained in API versions 2.1 and prior.
The deprecation schedule will be released at a later date, but we recommend that users begin using API v3.
For any questions or concerns, please reach out to the SEED team.
