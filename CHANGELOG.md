**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/SEED-platform/seed/compare/v2.16.0...v2.17.0

# SEED Version 2.16.0

This release contains new functionality to help track building-portfolio programs such as Benchmarking and basic-Building Performance Standards. In order to track programs, SEED was updated with a program configuration page with the selection of two metrics to track (an energy and emissions metric). The tracking requires an actual and a goal column to be defined allowing the program to determine if a property is in compliance.

A new program insight page was created to allow easy visualization over the compliance periods. In addition, new backend functionality was created for "filter groups" allowing for a user to save a set of labels and filters into a recallable filter group. The filter groups can be then aggregated with sums, averages, etc., and plotted on a custom report page.

Lastly, the new changelog format comes directly from GitHub now, removing the need to run the custom GitHub script.

# SEED Version 2.7.2

SEED Version 2.7.2 includes the introduction of API v3. This new API version will
enable users to "Try" v3 endpoints using the Swagger page as well as improve on and
consolidate previous API versions.  Endpoints have been copied over from previous versions.
Many were left as is - functionally remaining the same. Some were copied over and enhanced.
Others were identified as no longer used or redundant; these are slated for deprecation
and were not copied over at all.

The current list of endpoints slated for deprecation can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16SrXFM9ypLs5KD0MLrhvttIFO40rTU74mS438XchhAg/edit?usp=sharing).
Deprecation will occur with the deactivation of endpoints contained in API versions 2.1 and prior.
The deprecation schedule will be released at a later date, but we recommend that users begin using API v3.
For any questions or concerns, please reach out to the SEED team.
