## Standard Energy Efficiency Data (SEED) Platform™
[![Build Status][travis-img]][travis-url] [![Coverage Status][coveralls-img]][coveralls-url]

The SEED Platform is a web-based application that helps organizations easily manage data on the energy performance of large groups of buildings. Users can combine data from multiple sources, clean and validate it, and share the information with others. The software application provides an easy, flexible, and cost-effective method to improve the quality and availability of data to help demonstrate the economic and environmental benefits of energy efficiency, to implement programs, and to target investment activity.

The SEED application is written in Python/Django, with AngularJS, Bootstrap, and other javascript libraries used for the front-end. The back-end database is required to be PostgreSQL.

The SEED web application provides both a browser-based interface for users to upload and manage their building data, as well as a full set of APIs that app developers can use to access these same data management functions.


### Installation
* Production on Amazon Web Service: See [Installation Notes](http://www.github.com/seed-platform/seed/wiki/Installation)
* Development on Mac OSX: [Installation Notes](https://github.com/SEED-platform/seed/wiki/Development-version-of-SEED-on-a-Mac-OSX)
* Development using Docker: [Installation Notes](https://github.com/SEED-platform/seed/wiki/Development-version-of-SEED-on-a-Docker)

### Django Notes
Both Django and AngurlarJS are used for url routing.

Django routes are in `seed/urls/main.py`

Amazon AWS S3 Expires headers should be set on the AngularJS partials if using S3 with the management command: set_s3_expires_headers_for_angularjs_partials
 usage: `python manage.py set_s3_expires_headers_for_angularjs_partials --verbosity=3`

The default user invite reply-to email can be overridden in the config/settings/common.py file. The `SERVER_EMAIL` settings var is the reply-to email sent along with new account emails.

```python
# BE/settings/common.py
PASSWORD_RESET_EMAIL = 'reset@buildingenergy.com'
SERVER_EMAIL = 'no-reply@buildingenergy.com'
```

### AngularJS notes

#### Template Tags
Angular and Django both use `{{` and `}}` as variable delimiters, and thus the AngularJS variable delimiters are renamed `{$` and `$}`.

```
window.BE.apps.seed = angular.module('BE.seed', ['ngRoute', "ngCookies"], function ($interpolateProvider) {
        $interpolateProvider.startSymbol("{$");
        $interpolateProvider.endSymbol("$}");
    }
);
```

#### Django CSRF token and AJAX requests
For ease of making angular `$http` requests, we automatically add the CSRF token to all `$http` requests as recommended by http://django-angular.readthedocs.org/en/latest/integration.html#xmlhttprequest

```
window.BE.apps.seed.run(function ($http, $cookies) {
    $http.defaults.headers.common['X-CSRFToken'] = $cookies['csrftoken'];
});
```

#### Routes and Partials or Views
routes in `static/seed/js/seed.js` (the normal angularjs `app.js`)

```
window.BE.apps.seed.config(['$routeProvider', function ($routeProvider) {

        $routeProvider
            .when('/', {
                templateUrl: static_url + '/seed/partials/home.html'
            })
            .when('/projects', {
                controller: 'project_list_controller',
                templateUrl: static_url + '/seed/partials/projects.html'
            })
            .when('/buildings', {
                templateUrl: static_url + '/seed/partials/buildings.html'
            })
            .when('/admin', {
                controller: 'seed_admin_controller',
                templateUrl: static_url + '/seed/partials/admin.html'
            })
            .otherwise({ redirectTo: '/' });

    }]);
```
html partials in `static/seed/partials/`

on production and staging servers on AWS, or for the partial html templates loaded on S3, or a CDN, the external resource should be added to the white list in `static/seed/js/seed/js`

```
// white list for s3
window.BE.apps.seed.config(function( $sceDelegateProvider ) {
$sceDelegateProvider.resourceUrlWhitelist([
    // localhost
    'self',
    // AWS s3
    'https://be-*.amazonaws.com/**'
    ]);
});
```

#### Tests
JS tests can be run with Jasmine at the url `app/angular_js_tests/`

`python manage.py test --settings=config.settings.test` will run the python unit tests.

```console
$ coverage run manage.py test --settings=config.settings.test
$ coverage report --fail-under=83
```

`flake8` will run the PEP8 compliance tests. Its config is in [tox.ini](tox.ini)

```console
$ flake8
```

`jshint` will run the JS compliance tests. The jshint config is in [.jshintrc](.jshintrc)

```console
$ jshint seed/static/seed/js
```

### Running
The following two commands will run uwsgi and celeryd.

```
bin/start_uwsgi.sh
bin/start_celery.sh
```

In dev mode, you can start the Django dev server and celery:

```
./manage.py runserver
./manage.py celeryd -c 4 --loglevel=INFO -E --maxtasksperchild=1000
```

#### flower
monitor background tasks `flower --port=5555 --broker=redis://localhost:6379/1`
assuming your redis broker is running on `localhost` and on port `6379`, DB `1`. Then goto localhost:5555 to check celery.
If running on AWS, the `bin/start_flower.sh` will start flower on port `8080` and be available for google credentialed buildingenergy.com accounts.

### dev setup
* `git clone git@github.com:seed-platform/seed.git`
* install Postgres 9.3 and redis for cache and message broker
* use a virtualenv if desired
* create a `local_untracked.py` in the `config/settings` folder and add CACHE and DB config (example `local_untracked.py.dist`)
* `export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=config.settings.dev`
* `pip install -r requirements/local.txt`
* `./manage.py syncdb`
* `./manage.py migrate`
* `./manage.py create_default_user`
* `./manage.py runserver`
* `./manage.py celeryd`
* navaigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/app/#/profile/admin` in your browser to add users to organizations
    * each user must belong to an organization!
* main app runs at `127.0.0.1:8000/app`

The `python manage.py create_default_user` will setup a default `superuser`
which must be used to access the system the first time. The management command
can also create other superusers.

```console
./manage.py create_default_user --username=demo2@be.com --organization=be --password=demo123
```

### Logs
Information about  error logging can be found here - https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/topics/logging/

Below is a standard set of error messages from Django.

A logger is configured to have a log level. This log level describes the severity of the messages that the logger will handle. Python defines the following log levels:

    DEBUG: Low level system information for debugging purposes
    INFO: General system information
    WARNING: Information describing a minor problem that has occurred.
    ERROR: Information describing a major problem that has occurred.
    CRITICAL: Information describing a critical problem that has occurred.

Each message that is written to the logger is a Log Record. The log record is stored in the webserver & Celery
