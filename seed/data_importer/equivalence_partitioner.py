class EquivalencePartitioner(object):
    """Class for calculating equivalence classes on model States

    The EquivalencePartitioner is configured with a list of rules
    saying "two objects are equivalent if these two pieces of data are
    identical" or "two objects are not equivalent if these two pieces
    of data are different."  The partitioner then takes a group of
    objects (typically PropertyState and TaxLotState objects) and
    returns a partition of the objects (a collection of lists, where
    each object is a member of exactly one of the lists), where each
    list represents a "definitely distinct" element (i.e., two
    PropertyState objects with no values for pm_property_id,
    custom_id, etc may very well represent the same building, but we
    can't say that for certain).

    Some special cases that it handles based on SEED needs:

    - special treatment for matching based on multiple fields

    - Allowing one Field to hold "canonical" information (e.g., a
      building_id) and others (e.g., a custom_id) to hold potential
      information: when an alternate field (e.g., custom_id_1) is used,
      the logic does not necessarily assume the custom_id_1 means the
      portfolio manager id, unless p1.pm_property_id==p2.custom_id_1,
      etc.

    - equivalence/non-equivalence in both directions.  E.g. if
      ps1.pm_property_id == ps2.pm_property_id then ps1 represents the
      same object as ps2.  But if ps1.normalized_address ==
      ps2.normalized_address, then ps1 is related to ps2, unless
      ps1.pm_property_id != ps2.pm_property_id, in which case ps1
      definitely is not the same as ps2.
