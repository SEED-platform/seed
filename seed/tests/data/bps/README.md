# Instructions for Importing Test BPS Data

- Upload the "CBL-building-performance-standards-sample-XXXX" files in SEED.
- Upload the "BPS-sample-Targets-XXXX" files in SEED.
- Upload the following files in ESPM in order listed: Add Properties, Add Meters, and Add Bills To Meters.
  - Import data from ESPM through the ESPM integration in SEED (or manually export from within ESPM).
  - Import meter data from ESPM separately as xlsx file (you can use "ESPM_BPS_Sample_Meter_Readings.xlsx" file).
  - Import the report directly into SEED with ESPM login.
- Import "BPS_Sample_AT_XXXXX" files (Audit Template) in SEED. I think this has to be done one at a time.
  - Note that the energy use data in the Audit Template files have been copied from other properties with only the identifiable data (property name, PM Building ID, etc.) revised to match. Therefore, the measure and energy use data is not applicable. These files are only included to demonstrate how AT files can be imported.
  - For property 3303 Water Street, there have been three AT files generated to show an example of how measures may be implemented over time. In 2019, two measures are recommended and one measure is implemented each of the next two years.
