# Instructions for Importing Test BPS Data

- Upload the "CBL-building-performance-standards-sample-XXXX" files in SEED.
- Upload the "BPS-sample-Targets-XXXX" files in SEED.
- Upload the following files in ESPM in order listed: Add Properties, Add Meters, and Add Bills To Meters.
  - Import data from ESPM through the ESPM integration in SEED (or manually export from within ESPM).
  - Import meter data from ESPM separately as xlsx file.
  - Import the report directly into SEED with shared ESPM login of the `SEED_City_Test` user.
- Import "BPS_Sample_AT_XXXXX" files in SEED. I think this has to be done one at a time.
