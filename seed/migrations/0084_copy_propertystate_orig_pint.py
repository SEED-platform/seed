# rgm Jan 2018: The change-over to units-aware columns (ie. everything with
# `*_pint` as a suffix) is invasive and so inherently a bit risky, as there is a
# ton of existing data in production with NREL/LBL that makes use of these
# columns. We'd like to have an escape hatch in case of unforeseen problems,
# hence we're renaming the existing unitless columns for EUI and areas to be
# suffixed `*_orig` so that rolling back is a straightforward matter of:
#
# - removing the unit-aware application code, and
# - removing the suffix from the unitless columns
#
# Because the `*_pint` columns are new, the forward migration to _start_ using
# them is straightforward: just copy `*_orig` -> `*_pint` for every
# PropertyState. This works as a straight float copy because the Pint base
# units (ft² and kBtu/ft²/year) match the implicit units of the original
# EUI/area columns.
