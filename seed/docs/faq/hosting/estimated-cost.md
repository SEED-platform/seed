There are three hosting options:

1. Self-hosting on user-owned hardware
2. Self-hosting on the cloud (e.g. Amazon, Google Compute)
3. Paying a hosting provider. Several companies offer SEED as a hosted solution:
	* [ClearlyEnergy](https://www.clearlyenergy.com/)
	* [Earth Advantage](https://www.earthadvantage.org/creating-change/home-energy-score.html)
	* [Open](https://opentech.eco/)
	* [PSD Consulting](http://psdconsulting.com)
	See the [Technical Allies page](../technical_ally.md) for more information.

Options (1) and (2) are highly dependent on internal expertise and potential requirements related to sharing outside of a user's organization. Generally, cloud hosting simplifies management of networks, hardware, firewalls, and backups. An example SEED instance hosted in the cloud with staging and production environments costs approximately $1,000 to $1,500 per month for a large instance capable of processing records for an entire region.
