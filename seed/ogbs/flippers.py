Basic flipper library for hiding OGBS features for dark-launch

Could get super-complicated with this (eg. see https://github.com/disqus/gutter)
but our needs are pretty simple:

  - easily greppable to remove them later
  - boolean-only gate is fine (no progressive roll-out, deploy groups needed yet)
  - redeploy to toggle is OK, ie. no real persistence beyond the filesystem

Most of the adds here are based on some experience in doing dark-launch, in
that a major hazard is that this counts as high-interest technical debt and
can get out of hand if we don't clean them up:

  - will get a unit test failure if the flipper is too old
  - will get a noisy log message if used past the expires date to discourage
    flippers from hanging around after they're needed.

no point in following any particular API since:
  - if we need something more complicated we'll use a better lib
  - flippers shouldn't stick around long so we don't want to encourage
    sticking around by future-proofing the API.
