          <p>The Standard Energy Efficiency Data (SEED)&#8482; Platform is a
            software application that helps organizations easily manage
            data on the energy performance of large groups of
            buildings. Users can combine data from multiple sources,
            clean and validate it, and share the information with
            others. The software application provides an easy, flexible,
            and cost-effective method to improve the quality and
            availability of data to help demonstrate the economic and
            environmental benefits of energy efficiency, to implement
            programs, and to target investment activity.</p>
