class APIClient(object):
    """
    Implementation of a demonstration client for using SEED's API.

    Example Usage::

        client = APIClient('http://seeddomain.com',
                           api_key='your_key_here',
                           email_address='youremail@address.com')

        #get all orgs user belongs to
        client.get_organizations()

        #organization id 17 will now be used for most requests
        client.set_organization(17)

        #create a dataset
        client.create_dataset('dataset name here')
        >>> {u'id': 34, u'name': u'test_data_set2', u'status': u'success'}

        #upload a file
        client.upload_file('/path/to/file', 34, 'Assessed Raw')
        >>> {'import_file_id': 54,
             'success': true,
             'filename': 'DataforSEED_dos15.csv'}

        # save the file's to the DB as raw buildings
        client.save_raw_data(payload={'file_id': 54})
        >>> {u'progress_key': u':1:SEED:save_raw_data:PROG:54',
             u'status': u'success'}

        # check the progress of the saving
        client.progress(
            payload={'progress_key':':1:SEED:save_raw_data:PROG:54'}

        >>> {u'progress': 78,
             u'progress_key': u':1:SEED:save_raw_data:PROG:54'}

    For nearly all endpoints, functions named for the endpoint are created
    from the get_api_schema endpoint.  If an endpoint requires a payload
    it can be provided as a dictionary to the keyword 'payload'::

        client.update_project(
            payload={'project':
                {'project_slug': 'myproject',
                 'name': 'My Project',
                 'description': 'My description here',

                 'deadline_date': 1407200000
                 }
            }
        >>> {'status': 'success'}

    If an endpoint requires a GET query string, provide those parameters as
    a dict to the keyword 'params'::

        client.get_import_file(params={'import_file_id': 54})
        >>> {'status': 'success',
             'import_file': {<snip>}
