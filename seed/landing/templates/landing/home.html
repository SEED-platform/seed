                            <p>You, and your company or organization (the PROVIDER) have agreed to upload and provide PROPRIETARY DATA, including energy efficiency data, building data, and building energy performance data to the Standard Energy Efficiency Data (SEED™) Platform database that the U.S. Department of Energy (the Government) and Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC (“Alliance”) the manager and operator of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (“NREL”) (the RECIPIENT) have created and provide for use for registered users.</p>

                            <p>PROPRIETARY DATA is defined as follows:</p>
                            <p>(a) information that embody trade secrets or commercial or financial information that is confidential and privileged; (b) information that is confidential and privileged and developed at private expense (i.e., not with Federal funds); (c) information that is not customarily released to the public; and/or (d) information whose disclosure to the public could result in financial harm to the PROVIDER, to owners of buildings whose information is contained in the PROPRIETARY DATA, or to other stakeholders.</p>
                            <p>In order to upload PROPRIETARY DATA, you will be required to create an account and provide the RECIPIENT with a username, password, and email address.

                            <p>The PROPRIETARY DATA shall remain protected until the PROVIDER provides notice of termination of their account on the SEED Platform and provides notice to remove PROPRIETARY DATA from the SEED Platform database, at which time the RECIPIENT will promptly return and/or destroy the PROPRIETARY DATA uploaded in the SEED Platform database.</p>
                            <p>By providing the PROPRIETARY DATA, PROVIDER agrees to the following:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>PROVIDER has the authority to provide the PROPRIETARY DATA to the RECIPIENT, that the information provided constitutes PROPRIETARY DATA, and consents to the information provided being labeled and treated as PROPRIETARY DATA. If PROVIDER wishes to provide non-proprietary data, please contact <a href="mailto:BTODataTools@ee.doe.gov">BTODataTools@ee.doe.gov</a>.</li>
