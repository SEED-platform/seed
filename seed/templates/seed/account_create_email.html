  {% blocktrans %}SEED is easy, flexible, and cost effective software designed to help organizations clean, manage and share information about large portfolios of buildings. SEED is a free, open
    source web application that you can use privately.  While SEED was originally designed to help cities and States implement benchmarking programs for public or private buildings, it has the
    potential to be useful for many other activities by public entities, efficiency programs and private companies.{% endblocktrans %}
