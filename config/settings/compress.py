    Used with django-compress to properly link relative links (i.e. image URLs)
    within less files while compiling them to css files.
    `DEBUG` should be `True` to get compress to have the indented behavior.
    See bin/post_compile for current use.
    Example:
        ./manage compress --force --settings=config.settings.compress
