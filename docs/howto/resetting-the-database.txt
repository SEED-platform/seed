This is a brief description of how to drop and re-create the database
for the seed application.

There is a convenience script located at
seed/bin/drop_create_db.sh that will run these commands with
the defaults of username='demo@buildingenergy.com', password='demo',
and organization='demo'.

The first two commands below are commands distributed with the
Postgres database, and are not part of the seed application. The third
command below will create the required database tables for seed and
setup initial data that the application expects (initial columns for
BEDES). The last command below (spanning multiple lines) will create a
new superuser and organization that you can use to login to the
application, and from there create any other users or organizations
that you require.

Below are the commands for resetting the database and creating a new
user:

dropdb seed     # dropdb is a postgres command
createdb seed   # createdb is a postgres command
python manage.py syncdb --migrate
python manage.py create_default_user \
  --username='someuser@example.com'  \
  --password='somepassword!'         \
  --organization='some-org'
